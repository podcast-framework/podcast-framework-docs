# Quick Start

Get a production-ready podcast website running in **under 10 minutes**. This guide will walk you through creating a new podcast site from scratch.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** installed ([download here](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Git** installed ([download here](https://git-scm.com/))
- A **Sanity account** (free - sign up at [sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/))

:::tip[Time estimate]
This entire guide takes **5-10 minutes** from start to finish.
:::

## Step 1: Create Project

Use the Podcast Framework CLI to create a new project:

```bash
npm create podcast-framework my-podcast
```

This will:
- âœ… Clone the podcast-template repository
- âœ… Install all dependencies
- âœ… Set up the project structure
- âœ… Create a `.env.template` file

:::note
The CLI uses the [podcast-template](https://github.com/rejected-media/podcast-template) as a starting point, giving you a complete, working podcast site immediately.
:::

## Step 2: Navigate to Project

```bash
cd my-podcast
```

## Step 3: Set Up Sanity CMS

Initialize your Sanity project:

```bash
npx sanity@latest init
```

**Follow the prompts:**

1. **Create new project?** â†’ Yes
2. **Project name** â†’ `my-podcast` (or your podcast name)
3. **Use default dataset?** â†’ Yes
4. **Output path** â†’ `./sanity` (press Enter)
5. **Select project template** â†’ Clean project with no predefined schemas

:::caution[Important]
Write down your **Project ID** - you'll need it in the next step!
:::

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file from the template:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Sanity credentials:

```bash
# Sanity CMS
PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id-here"  # From Step 3
PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET="production"
PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION="2024-01-01"

# Site Configuration
PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:4321"
```

:::tip
The template includes commented examples for all optional services (Resend, ConvertKit, Google Analytics, Sentry). You can add these later!
:::

## Step 5: Deploy Sanity Schemas

Deploy the podcast schemas to your Sanity project:

```bash
cd sanity
npx sanity schema deploy
cd ..
```

This adds schemas for:
- Episodes
- Guests
- Hosts
- Podcast metadata
- Theme configuration
- Homepage configuration
- About page configuration
- Contributions

## Step 6: Start Development Servers

Start both the Astro dev server and Sanity Studio:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Astro dev server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Sanity Studio (in a new terminal)
npm run dev:sanity
```

Your podcast site is now running at:
- **Website:** http://localhost:4321
- **Sanity Studio:** http://localhost:3333

## Step 7: Add Your First Episode

1. Open Sanity Studio at http://localhost:3333
2. Click **"Podcast"** in the sidebar
3. Fill in your podcast information:
   - Name
   - Tagline

7. Fill in episode details:
   - Title
   - Episode number

   - Duration
   - Description
   - Links (Spotify, Apple, YouTube)
8. Click **"Publish"**

:::tip[RSS Import]
Have existing episodes? Import them from your RSS feed:

```bash
npm run import:episodes
```

This will fetch all episodes from your podcast RSS feed and create them in Sanity.
:::

2. Customize colors:
   - Primary color (links, buttons)
